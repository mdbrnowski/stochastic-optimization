# stochastic-optimization

This repository is a comparison of Pure Random Search (PRS) and a Genetic Algorithm (GA) using Ackley and Rosenbrock functions across dimensions 2, 10, and 20. It includes visual comparisons of algorithm performance and statistical analysis (using Welch's t-tests) to evaluate the significance of the differences in their results. The [report](report.pdf) is written only in Polish.
